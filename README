Note: The program asks the user to enter the number of cannibals and missionaries. It then returns the number of boat
crossing needed if there is a solution, or prints 'No solution exists' if there is no solution.

Findings: 
(a) If the boat holds 2 people at max, then there is no solution for 4 or more couples. (couple: 1 cannibal + 1 missionary)
(b) However, there does exist solutions for 8 or more than 8 people, if the missionaries outnumber the cannibals in the
    intial configuration. For example, an initial configuration of <cannibals = 4, missionaries = 5, boat at left> has a solution.
